Doubt I'll use this much.

Set up a little personal website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for easy set up, deployment and free *(free)* hosting.

The main thing I really like about using Jekyll is that creating posts are simply editing easy-to-read Markdown files and then pushing updates with git, making the whole process very worry-free.

Disasstisfied with the default theme, I'm using [getmicah's basic theme](https://github.com/getmicah/getmicah.github.io), though I plan to slowly customise this as I go.
